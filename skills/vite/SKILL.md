# Vite

> Based on Vite 8 beta (Rolldown-powered). Vite 8 uses Rolldown bundler and Oxc transformer.

Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool with fast dev server (native ESM + HMR) and optimized production builds.

## Preferences

- Use TypeScript: prefer `vite.config.ts`
- Always use ESM, avoid CommonJS

## Core

| Configuration | `vite.config.ts`, `defineConfig`, conditional configs, `loadEnv` | [core-config](references/core-config.md) |
| Features | `import.meta.glob`, asset queries (`?raw`, `?url`), `import.meta.env`, HMR API | [core-features](references/core-features.md) |
| Plugin API | Vite-specific hooks, virtual modules, plugin ordering | [core-plugin-api](references/core-plugin-api.md) |

## Build & SSR

| Topic | Description | Reference |

## 7. Status checklist per data point (Gate 7)

Every numeric value, name, or factual claim in **vite** output must carry an EXPLICIT label so the reader knows what to trust as-is and what needs verification before action.

- 🔵 **verified** — confirmed from a primary source (file, audit log, session memory, RAG hit, screen-shared confirmation)
- 🟡 **assumed** — plausible default that needs client/owner confirmation before being acted on
- 🟢 **projection** — estimate by design (timeline, cost, throughput, conversion); not verifiable today

**Why this gate exists:** outputs that mix verified facts with assumptions and projections without flagging them produce false certainty. The reader either over-trusts (acts on a guess) or under-trusts (ignores even the verified parts). Explicit labels restore signal.

**How to apply in vite:**

1. After drafting the deliverable, scan it for every concrete claim (number, name, date, metric, status, recommendation).
2. Attach one of the three labels inline; if you can't pick a label confidently, the claim isn't ready to ship.
3. Add a short citation in parentheses for 🔵 items (file path, source, dashboard) and a short condition for 🟡 / 🟢 items (what would confirm or refute it).
4. End the deliverable with a 1-line summary of how many items in each category, e.g. `Status mix: 8 🔵 · 3 🟡 · 2 🟢`.

❌ **NOT delivery-ready:**

```
Conversion rate is 18%. CAC is R$ 420. We will hit 1k MAU in Q3.
```

✅ **Delivery-ready:**

```
- Conversion rate: 18% 🔵 verified (Mixpanel funnel report 2026-05-19, n=1,242 sessions)
- CAC: R$ 420 🟡 assumed (calculated from May spend ÷ May customers; CFO has not signed off yet)
- 1k MAU in Q3 🟢 projection (linear extrapolation of last 8 weeks; assumes no churn spike)

Status mix: 1 🔵 · 1 🟡 · 1 🟢
```

**Ship checklist post-cliente-sync:**
- [ ] All 🟡 items confirmed (or downgraded to 🟢 / dropped)
- [ ] All 🔵 citations actually exist (no broken file paths, no imagined sources)
- [ ] All 🟢 projections labeled as such to the client — never presented as commitments
